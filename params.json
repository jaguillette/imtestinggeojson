I am on Ubuntu, but Mac is unix-based so it shouldn't be too different. Heaven help you if you're using Windows.\r\n\r\nUsed script from here: https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson\r\n`git clone https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson` in a terminal on a machine with git\r\n\r\nHad to install node.js and npm, followed directions here: https://ariejan.net/2011/10/24/installing-node-js-and-npm-on-ubuntu-debian/\r\nVersion on this site is out of date, so just don't pick one. Takes a while, and I had to move the node folder to /usr/local/lib, which was indicated in the error messages I got when I tried it the way the site said.\r\n\r\nFinally, don't forget to do this:\r\n`npm install -g togeojson`\r\nI had to sudo it to get it to work.\r\n\r\nThen, you can use a line like this one to convert batches of kmls to geojson:\r\n`for f in *.kml; do togeojson $f > ${f%%.*}.geojson; done`\r\nThat'll take every kml file in the current directory and convert it to a geojson in the same directory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
